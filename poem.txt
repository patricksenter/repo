 Against the planks of the cabin side,
        (So slight a thing between them and me,)
    The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
        The great green waves of the Indian sea!

    Your face was white as the foam is white,
        Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
    I would we had steamed and reached that night
        The sea's last edge, the end of the world.
