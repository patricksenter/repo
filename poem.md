#Sea Song

By Laurence Hope (Adela Florence Cory Nicolson)


Against the planks of the cabin side,

(So slight a thing between them and me,)

The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,

The great green waves of the _Indian sea_!



Your face was white as the foam is white,

Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,

I would we had steamed and reached that night

The sea's last edge, *the end of the world*.
